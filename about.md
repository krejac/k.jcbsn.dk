  Hey there! This page is an archive of stuff I care about or somehow use some left over brain capacity on. It's not much but I guess that matches the brain capacity. 
</p>

Hi, I'm Kresten. I'm into Cyber stuff, my family and my beautifull wife. I also like the occasional running trip, watching soccer and a nice beer. 

## Setup

The foundation for this site is the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the theme is [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com). 

The site is:   

* Written in markdown with [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807)
* Developed and published on GitHub for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Deployed and hosted for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

Thanks for reading!
